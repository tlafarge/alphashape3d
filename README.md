# alphashape3d

The package __alphashape3d__ presents the implementation in R of the __alpha-shape__ of a finite set of points in the __three-dimensional__ space. This geometric structure generalizes the convex hull and allows to recover the shape of non-convex and even non-connected sets in 3D, given a random sample of points taken into it. Besides the computation of the alpha-shape, the package __alphashape3d__ provides users with functions to compute the volume of the alpha-shape, identify the connected components and facilitate the three-dimensional graphical visualization of the estimated set.
