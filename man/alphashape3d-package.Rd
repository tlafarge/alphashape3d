\title{Computation of the 3D \eqn{\alpha}-shape}
\description{
Implementation in R of the \eqn{\alpha}-shape of a finite set of points in
the three-dimensional space. The \eqn{\alpha}-shape generalizes the convex
hull and allows to recover the shape of non-convex and even non-connected
sets in 3D, given a random sample of points taken into it. Besides the
computation of the \eqn{\alpha}-shape, this package provides users with
functions to compute the volume of the \eqn{\alpha}-shape, identify the
connected components and facilitate the three-dimensional graphical
visualization of the estimated set.
