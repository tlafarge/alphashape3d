\title{Connected subsets computation}
\usage{
components_ashape3d(as3d, indexAlpha = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{as3d}{An object of class \code{"ashape3d"} that represents the
\eqn{\alpha}-shape of a given sample of points in the three-dimensional
space, see \code{\link{ashape3d}}.}

\item{indexAlpha}{A single value or vector with the indexes of
\code{as3d$alpha} that should be used for the computation, see Details.}
}
\value{
If \code{indexAlpha} is a single value then the function returns a
vector \code{v} of length equal to the sample size. For each sample point
\code{i}, \code{v[i]} represents the label of the connected component to
which the point belongs (for isolated points, \code{v[i]=-1}). The labels of
the connected components are ordered by size where the largest one (in
number of vertices) gets the smallest label which is one.

Otherwise \code{components_ashape3d} returns a list of vectors describing
the connected components of the \eqn{\alpha}-shape for each selected value
of \eqn{\alpha}.
}
\description{
This function calculates and clusters the different connected components of
the \eqn{\alpha}-shape of a given sample of points in the three-dimensional
space.
}
\details{
The function \code{components_ashape3d} computes the connected components of
the \eqn{\alpha}-shape for each value of \eqn{\alpha} in
\code{as3d$alpha[indexAlpha]} when \code{indexAlpha} is numeric.

If \code{indexAlpha="all"} or \code{indexAlpha="ALL"} then the function
computes the connected components of the \eqn{\alpha}-shape for all values
of \eqn{\alpha} in \code{as3d$alpha}.
